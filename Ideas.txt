1, auto encoder/restricted boltzman machine + CNN
2, CNN + RNN (video processing, ucf101: http://crcv.ucf.edu/data/UCF101.php)
2.1 there have been some works which uses CNN+RNN to process videos. 
2.2 Pre-train method: use pre-trained CNN to preprocess image, then feed the preprocessed image to RNN
2.3 Seq-to-Seq: use one model to train CNN+RNN simutaneously. There is done by several 2015 ICCV paper (good place to start: youtube video captioning). 
2.4 
3, auto encoder/restricted boltzman machine + RNN
4, hava siegelmann
5, deep boltzmann machine with external memory
6, memory network, dynamic memory network
7, autoencoder + DNC
8, make a website and let a lot of people to help me to train the agent.
